## Strategy

1. Should Airbnb expand into car rentals?
2. How should Netflix respond to YouTubeâ€™s growing popularity?
3. How would you decide between entering a new market vs. doubling down on existing ones?
4. Build a go-to-market strategy for a new feature on Slack.
5. How should a startup decide whether to monetize early or grow first?
